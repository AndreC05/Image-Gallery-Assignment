# Image-Gallery-Assignment

Week 1 Project

Requirements achieved:
-Responsive design using media queries to ensure the website works well on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens.
-All images have appropriate alt text attributes for accessibility.
-Event handlers to switch images based on user interactions.

Stretch goals implemented:
-Media queries for 3 screen sizes.
-Left and Right arrow keys to switch between images.
-"srcset" used to specify which image will be loaded based on the size of the screen.
-ARIA elements added to improve accessibility ("aria-selected" and "aria-live").

Most challenging parts to implement:
-Using queryselector to get the new image to be focused.
-"srcset and "sizes" change the image to be loaded but not at the right screen sizes.
